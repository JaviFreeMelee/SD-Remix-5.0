* Onett-Ville: an Onett-themed take on Smashville whose platform doesn't go offstage

* Termina Secret: A Tri-Plat stage, at least until the top platform goes away. Don't worry, it comes back.

* Metal Cavern: P+ players should recognize this, as it's the symmetrical, 1-platform version they're familiar with

* Race to the Finish: A small stage with four platforms, reminiscent of Wario-Ware from future Smash titles

* Town Greens: A Tri-Plat stage with a wide, low center platform, and two higher platforms overhanging each edge.

* Yoshi's Zone: A medium sized stage with a single platform moving slowly, on a swing.

* Kalos League: A large stage with platforms overhanging each ledge, as seen in newer titles.

* Brinstar Lab: A stage with two platforms, which cycle between two layouts.

* Mushroom Panic: A small stage with a single, low, wide center platform, and two platforms off the side of the level. Be careful, though, these fall when you stand on them too long.

* Kongo Jungle 64: A remix of the classic stage, which flattens it, removes the barrel, makes the stage solid and rearranges the platforms.

* Kongo Falls: A small tri-plat, with uneven, staggered platform heights.

* Mute Circuit: Has a wide, moving lower platform, and a higher, small center platform.

* Cookie Land: Based on the classic level in Double Dash, this smaller stage features platforms overhanging each ledge, and a slightly higher platform in the center.

* Tree House: A remodeled version of the stage of the same name seen in SD Remix and other mods. One center platform on a relatively medium stage.

* Rainbow Ride: A small tri-plat, but the top platform moves slowly back and forth along the level.

* Arena Ferox: A home stage for the Fire Emblem characters in melee, the two platforms on this stage resemble the side platforms on Battlefield.

* Poké Float Stadium 2: This stage's layout resembles the original Stadium, but it has no transformations, and changes to the platforms and ledges, as well as a bunch of Pokémon in the background!

* Infinite Glacier: A casual stage you may remember from PM, this one platform stage is very wide and very slippery.
